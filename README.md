### 🌌 Aura Gaze
Where friendship meets the stars, and technology meets emotion.

### 📌 Project Title
Aura Gaze – AI Best Friend Selection Portal

# 📖 Project Description
Aura Gaze is an emotionally immersive web experience where users build a deep bond with their AI best friend. Starting with just a name, users are guided through a visual journey of choosing their perfect best friend — male or female — and even selecting an age group (school friend, young adult, or elder companion).

The user then selects from a set of curated images to represent their best friend visually. Once selected, an AI chat begins where the best friend feels real — greeting, checking in, and even celebrating birthdays like a true companion.

Aura Gaze is not just an app — it’s a portal to an emotionally intelligent, visually personalized friendship.
